Here are all the required installations needed before running the project.
These include system requirements, Python packages, frontend dependencies, and Ollama setup.

✅ 2. Required Python Packages

These go inside requirements.txt and must be installed via pip:

     fastapi
     uvicorn
     httpx
     pydantic

Install them:

     pip install -r requirements.txt

✅ 3. Required Ollama Models

You must install all the models used in the dropdown:

     ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:1.5b
     ollama pull deepseek-coder:1.3b
     ollama pull llama3.2:1b
     ollama pull qwen2.5:0.5b

or install only what you plan to use.

✅ 4. Required Services Running

Before starting the backend:

Start Ollama service using the below command in your terminal:
     
     ollama serve

✅ 5. Frontend Requirements

➡️ No Node.js, no npm, no framework required.

Just open:

     frontend/index.html

in any browser.

Your frontend dependencies are loaded via CDN: marked.js (markdown parser)

So no installation is needed.
